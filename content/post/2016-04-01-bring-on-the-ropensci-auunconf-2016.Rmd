I'll be heading to the [2016 ROpenSci un-conference](http://auunconf.ropensci.org) (hackathon) in Brisbane later this month to smash out a heap of open-science R code. Ideas are already flowing quite nicely, and I'm confident that any ideas we don't end up officially working on will get their chance in the very near future.

I'll be heading to the [2016 ROpenSci un-conference](http://auunconf.ropensci.org) (hackathon) in Brisbane later this month to smash out a heap of open-science R code. Ideas are already flowing quite nicely, and I'm confident that any ideas we don't end up officially working on will get their chance in the very near future.

One thing I noticed from the organisers was that coffee won't be provided in an official sense. As a physicist at heart, that's strange (scary) yet understandable (physics conferences go through an astounding amount of coffee; we once had a full-time barista on deck). There are supposedly plenty of nearby places to get a good coffee, but where? Time for some R code!

This ended up being a little easier than I first thought thanks to [someone already identifying the right Google Places API endpoint and providing an example function](http://stackoverflow.com/a/34802126/4168169). I re-wrote the function to be a bit more general and to suit my needs a little better. After that it's just a matter of extracting and plotting locations, adding a 2d density, and prettifying the output.

I'm loving [hrbrmstr's annotations additions](http://rud.is/b/2016/03/16/supreme-annotations/) to `ggplot2`; I think they really bring R graphics into a professional appearance. I have a feeling that my locations when not at the hackathon itself will correlate well with this density map as I try to find the best local coffee.

Stay tuned for updates on the projects we end up developing. I have a good feeling that they're going to be somewhat awesome.

Suggestions on the above code most welcome. Also, if you happen to know of a great coffee house near there that isn't listed, hit the comments section!
