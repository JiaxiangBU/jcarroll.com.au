<p>It didn’t take long, actually. Despite my searches while trying to get <a href="http://jcarroll.com.au/2016/06/02/images-as-x-axis-labels/" target="_blank">images into x-axis labels</a> it seems I overlooked a working, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14070953/photo-alignment-with-graph-in-r/14078391" target="_blank">significantly less hacky implementation</a>. My Google-fu had in fact let me down.</p>
<p>Baptiste Auguié (<a href="https://twitter.com/tpab" target="_blank"><span class="citation">@tpab</span></a> / <a href="https://github.com/baptiste" target="_blank"><span class="citation">@baptiste</span></a>) had this working a while ago (seemingly before the <code>ggplot2</code> update that broke other methods), and in a definitively less hacky way. I’ve added a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jonocarroll/2f9490f1f5e7c82ef8b791a4b91fc9ca" target="_blank">new gist</a> (if you’re reading this on R-bloggers, the gist isn’t embedded, so either follow the link or view on my site) which implements it on the same graph as earlier, and I like this significantly more.</p>

This method gets around the <code>element_text()</code> validation and updates the grobs in a way that’s above my pay grade/understanding of <code>ggplot2</code> internals, and is a much more consistent way to go about it. This also:
<ul>
<li>
places the factor labels on the graph along with the picture, covering some concerns about people not knowing which maps are for which country,
</li>
<li>
leaves room for the <code>caption</code> to go back in, which I wanted,
</li>
<li>
automatically scales the grob better,
</li>
<li>
doesn’t involve creating an external <code>grob</code> and thus turning off clipping; using <code>axis.text.x</code> is exactly what I was hoping for.
</li>
</ul>

<p class="caption">Updated version using <span class="citation">@baptiste</span>’s method; much better.</p>
</div>
<p>My version worked (sort of) but only because it used options that were bad practice (not doubting that for a moment). I’d like to see this method make it into <code>ggplot2</code> properly; Baptiste had an <a href="https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/issues/1240" target="_blank">open GitHub issue</a> involving it a while ago but it has since been closed, presumably without the feature being incorporated.</p>
<p>I started the previous post by saying how awesome open-source software is (e.g. <code>R</code>). You know what else is awesome? The #rstats community. Thank you to every one of you.</p>
