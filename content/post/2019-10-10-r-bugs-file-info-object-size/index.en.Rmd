As soon as the [R-Foundation posted that they're inviting cleanup of old bugs](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/10/09/r-can-use-your-help-reviewing-bug-reports/index.html), 
I knew it would be an opportunity to learn more about the way R works on the inside.

As soon as the [R-Foundation posted that they're inviting cleanup of old bugs](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/10/09/r-can-use-your-help-reviewing-bug-reports/index.html), 
I knew it would be an opportunity to learn more about the way R works on the inside.

I started looking through the list of open bugs for somewhere I could help out. I barely know
anything about the actual [C internals of the language](https://colinfay.me/r-internals/r-internal-structures.html) 
(I'm hoping to learn) so I figured it would be best to start with some parts of the code I'm familiar with.

I had an [open bug report](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16877) for the 
internals of `glm` which I extended with a reproducible example. I had another look through the 
open bug reports for "glm" in case there was another report of this that I had overlooked (not that I can find) 
and found another which seemed fairly straightforward - [some out of date documentation](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16522).

![Bug 16522](/2019-10-10-r-bugs-file-info-object-size/index.en_files/glm_bug.png)

That seems approachable. I tested that the documentation was still in that state (it was) and 
that the example did what it said (it did). Lastly, I read through the source of that function to 
double-check that the return value would indeed be more general. In fact, the `method` return value 
could be either the name of the fitting function as a character string, e.g. 

```{r glm_method}
glm.fit2 <- glm.fit
glm(1:4 ~ rnorm(4), method = "glm.fit2")$method
```

or the actual function definition, if it was provided that way

```{r glm_method2}
head(glm(1:4 ~ rnorm(4), method = glm.fit)$method)
```

(truncated for simplicity).

This made for a small, (-2/+3)-line [patch](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=2463&action=diff) 
which was accepted and is now part of the source of R.

Sidenote: I made this patch using git, but I should really be doing this via SVN. 
[This thread](https://twitter.com/michael_chirico/status/1181930491575848961) 
by [Michael Chirico](https://twitter.com/michael_chirico) is what I'll be following 
from here on.

Now, on to the next bug.

I had a browse through the sections and found [this one](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15389)
from 2013

![Bug 15389](/2019-10-10-r-bugs-file-info-object-size/index.en_files/file.info.png)

That seems innocent enough, right? My experience with `object.size` is when I look at how much 
memory a given object is taking up (incorrectly, I now understand after reading [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/memory.html#object-size)). What I always liked about this function was that it 
has a `format` method so I could easily convert the standard output

```{r default size mtcars}
object.size(mtcars)
```

into a different unit very easily

```{r mtcars in kb}
format(object.size(mtcars), "KB")
```

Of course, in order to do this (to know to convert from bytes to Kb) the object needs to be classed 
appropriately. That's the case, here

```{r class of object.size}
class(object.size(mtcars))
```
 
That isn't the case for the `size` element of `file.info`, though

```{r file.info.size}
example_file <- file.path(.Library, "base", "R", "base.rdb")
file.info(example_file)[, c("size", "isdir", "mode")]
```

which is just a number

```{r file.info.size_num}
class(file.info(example_file)$size)
```

The suggestion is to make this of class `object_size`, which would enable the 
nice formatting of the unit (even though a 'file' is not an 'object'). Seems fair, let's 
have a look at what needs to happen to make that work - hopefully it's as simple as 
adding a class to the `size` element. I use RStudio, and I have a copy of the r-source 
in a project, so I can simply <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> to search all 
files in this project for "file.info". Sure enough, it's in [`/src/library/base/R/files.R`](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/a5504314e6164e88953ed5bc10cd8b23e6a9685e/src/library/base/R/files.R#L164-L173)

```{r file.info source}
file.info <- function(..., extra_cols = TRUE)
{
    res <- .Internal(file.info(fn <- c(...), extra_cols))
    res$mtime <- .POSIXct(res$mtime)
    res$ctime <- .POSIXct(res$ctime)
    res$atime <- .POSIXct(res$atime)
    class(res) <- "data.frame"
    attr(res, "row.names") <- fn # not row.names<- as that does a length check
    res
}
```

Not much to it, but some surprises for sure. What immediately jumps out to me is that 
the fact that the result is a `data.frame` is achieved through the very hacky "slap a 
class on it" method rather than `as.data.frame()`. The call to `.Internal` means the 
actual work is done at the C level, so there may not be much hope changing the class of the 
size there.

The simplest thing would appear to be to convert `res$size` to class `object_size` as soon 
as it's created. There's sometimes a converting function, e.g. `as.object_size`, but I don't see 
one here. Looking at the internals of the `object.size` function 

```{r object.size function}
object.size
```

suggests it's safe enough to slap the class on an object, so let's try that. I'll rename 
this function for now so we can see if it's working

```{r test adding class, error = TRUE}
file.info2 <- function(..., extra_cols = TRUE)
{
    res <- .Internal(file.info(fn <- c(...), extra_cols))
    class(res$size) <- "object_size"
    res$mtime <- .POSIXct(res$mtime)
    res$ctime <- .POSIXct(res$ctime)
    res$atime <- .POSIXct(res$atime)
    class(res) <- "data.frame"
    attr(res, "row.names") <- fn # not row.names<- as that does a length check
    res
}

file.info2(example_file)
```

Well, that didn't work. Huh. Did we do something wrong?

```{r check size element}
file.info2(example_file)$size
```

No, that actually works. Did it actually fail to return an object?

```{r check output}
fi <- file.info2(example_file)
```

Huh, that works, too. Can we see what's inside?

```{r check str of fi}
str(fi)
```

Well, that looks to be what we wanted - the `size` element has the right class. If we print this, however

```{r print fi, error = TRUE}
print(fi)
```

So, the issue seems to be in the print method somewhere. using `traceback()` we can see
that the error comes from this line in `utils:::format.object_size` which seems to be having 
trouble finding the `digits` value

```r
paste(round(x/base^power, digits = digits), unit)
```

The formal arguments for `utils:::format.object_size` has a default of `digits = 1L` so why is it not being found? Tracing back 
further we see that the `format.object_size` method was called from `format.data.frame` which loops through 
the columns of the `data.frame` and formats them according to each class there

```r
format.data.frame <- function(x, ..., justify = "none")
{
    nc <- length(x)
    <...>
    rval <- vector("list", nc)
    for(i in seq_len(nc))
       rval[[i]] <- format(x[[i]], ..., justify = justify)
    <...>
```

but there's no mention of `digits` here. Tracing even further back, this is called from `print.data.frame` and 
passes its `digits` argument. That function has the signature

```r
print.data.frame <-
    function(x, ..., digits = NULL, quote = FALSE, right = TRUE,
	     row.names = TRUE, max = NULL)
```

and now we can see where the problem comes from - we try to print our `data.frame` which has an `object_size` 
column, but that print method sets `digits = NULL` which is passed to `format.data.frame` which is passed to 
`format.object_size` which has no way to deal with `digits = NULL`. Ugh.

Can we test that? Sure, let's create a simple `data.frame`, make a column be `object_size`, and try to 
print it

```{r test theory, error = TRUE}
df <- data.frame(x = 1, y = 2048)
print(df)

class(df$y) <- "object_size"
print(df)
```

This is the behaviour if we auto-print an object by just referencing it by name

```{r test print, error = TRUE}
df
```

but what if we *do* provide the `digits` argument to an actual call?

```{r print with digits}
print(df, digits = 1L)
```

SOLVED! But what to do about it? I see three options:

**OPTION 1**: Don't default to `digits = NULL` in `print.data.frame`. I'm not sure what the 
consequence of this would be across all calls to this function, but I can't imagine there's much 
use for that default. A better default would seem to be 

```{r options digits}
getOption("digits")
```

Looking at `?options` we can see how this is intended to be used

> digits: 
> controls the number of significant digits to print when printing numeric values. 
> It is a suggestion only. Valid values are 1...22 with default 7. See the note 
> in print.default about values greater than 15.

**OPTION 2**: Make `round` deal with `NULL` values. I worry that is already handled in that an 
error message appropriate to that function is generated

```{r round fail, error = TRUE}
round(3.14159, digits = NULL)
```

**OPTION 3**: Make `format.object_size` capable of dealing with `digits = NULL`. The fact that it 
has no way of dealing with this value seems like an oversight, since it *must* be a valid value
in order to pass it to `round`. Again, the option of using a more sensible default comes to mind, 
but there already *is* a default in place here (`digits = 1L`) it's just being overridden. 

Instead, we would need some sort of handling in this situation, such as

```
digits <- ifelse(is.null(digits), 1L, digits)

## or 

digits <- ifelse(is.null(digits), getOption("digits"), digits)
```

I *think* this last option is the most satisfactory (though perhaps the first should 
also be addressed) so let's see if that's sufficient. Unfortunately, since the issue 
is deeply nested within another function's namespace, we can't just write a new 
`format.object_size` and call `print.data.frame` and expect it to work (without 
rebuilding R itself -- learning how to do that is on my TODO list). What we can do, 
though, is to write a `format.object_size3`, class our new column as `object_size3`, and 
test *that*. With this new function written, we get

```{r format2}
format.object_size3 <- function(x, units = "b", standard = "auto", digits = 1L, ...)
{
  known_bases <- c(legacy = 1024, IEC = 1024, SI = 1000)
  known_units <- list(
    SI     = c("B", "kB",  "MB",  "GB", "TB", "PB",  "EB",  "ZB",  "YB"),
    IEC    = c("B", "KiB", "MiB", "GiB","TiB","PiB", "EiB", "ZiB", "YiB"),
    legacy = c("b", "Kb",  "Mb",  "Gb", "Tb", "Pb"),
    LEGACY = c("B", "KB",  "MB",  "GB", "TB", "PB") # <- only for "KB"
  )
  
  units <- match.arg(units,
                     c("auto", unique(unlist(known_units), use.names = FALSE)))
  standard <- match.arg(standard, c("auto", names(known_bases)))
  digits <- ifelse(is.null(digits), 1L, digits) # added
  
  if (standard == "auto") { ## infer 'standard' from 'units':
    standard <- "legacy" # default; may become "SI"
    if (units != "auto") {
      if (endsWith(units, "iB"))
        standard <- "IEC"
      else if (endsWith(units, "b"))
        standard <- "legacy"   ## keep when "SI" is the default
      else if (units == "kB")
        ## SPECIAL: Drop when "SI" becomes the default
        stop("For SI units, specify 'standard = \"SI\"'")
    }
  }
  base      <- known_bases[[standard]]
  units_map <- known_units[[standard]]
  
  if (units == "auto") {
    power <- if (x <= 0) 0L else min(as.integer(log(x, base = base)),
                                     length(units_map) - 1L)
  } else {
    power <- match(toupper(units), toupper(units_map)) - 1L
    if (is.na(power))
      stop(gettextf("Unit \"%s\" is not part of standard \"%s\"",
                    sQuote(units), sQuote(standard)), domain = NA)
  }
  unit <- units_map[power + 1L]
  ## SPECIAL: Use suffix 'bytes' instead of 'b' for 'legacy' (or always) ?
  if (power == 0 && standard == "legacy") unit <- "bytes"
  
  paste(round(x / base^power, digits=digits), unit)
}

file.info3 <- function(..., extra_cols = TRUE)
{
    res <- .Internal(file.info(fn <- c(...), extra_cols))
    class(res$size) <- "object_size3"
    res$mtime <- .POSIXct(res$mtime)
    res$ctime <- .POSIXct(res$ctime)
    res$atime <- .POSIXct(res$atime)
    class(res) <- "data.frame"
    attr(res, "row.names") <- fn # not row.names<- as that does a length check
    res
}

file.info3(example_file)[, c("size", "isdir", "mode")]
```

It works! 

As of R 3.2.0 there are also some helper extractors of these elements (mode, mtime, size) 
so our improvement extends to `file.size`. We can test this if we update the helper to 
use our version

```{r file.size}
file.size3 <- function(...) file.info3(..., extra_cols = FALSE)$size
file.size3(example_file)
```

We can format that specifically

```{r file.size format}
format(file.size3(example_file), "KB")
```

but it doesn't print nicely on its own here. This is because we've artificially changed 
the class to `object_size3` so we're no longer plugging in to all the methods for `object_size`. I 
could go through and redefine all of those, but for testing, it's easier to just reset everything 
to `object_size`, define `file.size` to use my custom version, and test that, and that works.

I've seen others create a package containing the modified code so that all of the namespacing 
works out, but in this case it would be a large chunk of the print, subset, and format methods.

Are we done? What about another look at that `class(res) <- "data.frame"` business?

Would it make more sense for that to use `res <- as.data.frame(res)`? Let's try

```{r as.data.frame, error = TRUE}
file.info4 <- function(..., extra_cols = TRUE)
{
    res <- .Internal(file.info(fn <- c(...), extra_cols))
    class(res$size) <- "object_size3"
    res$mtime <- .POSIXct(res$mtime)
    res$ctime <- .POSIXct(res$ctime)
    res$atime <- .POSIXct(res$atime)
    res <- as.data.frame(res)
    attr(res, "row.names") <- fn # not row.names<- as that does a length check
    res
}

file.info4(example_file)
```

Fair enough, there's probably no `as.data.frame.object_size3` method (the 3 is for our convenience, but 
there's no `as.data.frame.object_size` either). It's simple enough to add

```{r as.data.frame.object_size, error = TRUE}
as.data.frame.object_size3 <- as.data.frame.vector

file.info4(example_file)
```

The "mode" element has the file permissions as `octmode`. I feel we're getting a bit 
off track if we need to add a lot of other `as.data.frame` methods, but 
here we go

```{r as.data.frame.octmode}
as.data.frame.octmode <- as.data.frame.vector

file.info4(example_file)
```

Right, that's working. I'll raise the question of whether or not it's worth the 
effort to support the `as.data.frame` conversion or whether the forcing of the class is 
better - I'm honestly not sure which.

I wrote a [bug report and corresponding patch](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17628) that adds the new test for `NULL` line to the definition of 
`format.object_size` and submitted that. 

I then wrote [another patch](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=2470&action=diff) to [the bug report this started with](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15389) which 
implements this (now minor) change to the size element of `file.info`. It may be the 
case that neither is welcome in the core source, and that's fine. The bug can be closed 
as WONTFIX.

I've learned a lot about how the components of these work, and either way a bug 
should get closed. I'm off to find the next one.

*Addendum*: I wanted to test this out properly, so I rebuilt my modified version of R 
(with these two patches in place) from source using docker. Assuming you have docker set up, this seems to do the trick

```bash
## pull the r-base docker image
## this has most of the requirements to build R
docker pull r-base

## run the image with a command-line
## with your local svn repository mounted
## your path to your svn directory will vary
docker run -ti -v /home/USER/svn/:/svn/ r-base /bin/bash 

## update whatever is necessary to build R from the svn source
apt update
apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev 
apt-get install texinfo ## needed to build manuals
apt-get install texlive-latex-base ## needed to build vignettes
apt-get install texlive-latex-extra ## sty files
apt-get install subversion ## to work with svn

## ensure svn is up to date
cd /svn/r-devel/
svn update

## build R and check that it works
## we're just using the command line, so X11 is not needed
## we're just building the source, so we don't need e.g. MASS
## we don't need to be using java, so don't include that
./configure --with-x=no --without-recommended-packages --disable-byte-compiled-packages --disable-java
## make in parallel
make -j4
make check
make check-all
make install

bin/R
## R Under development (unstable) (2019-10-10 r77275) -- "Unsuffered Consequences"
```

Woohoo!

Note that this is ephemeral - the changes won't persist after you stop the image. To prevent 
that, we can save the image for re-use (from outside the image)

```bash
## your image ID will be different
docker commit -m "build env" 8f42f23123dd r-build-env
```

With that built, we can try out our patched functions (not run locally here)

```r
example_file <- file.path(.Library, "base", "R", "base.rdb")
file.info(example_file)[, c("size", "isdir", "mode")]
#>                                              size isdir mode
#> /svn/r-devel/library/base/R/base.rdb 357435 bytes FALSE  644

file.size(example_file)
#> 357435 bytes

format(file.size(example_file), "KB")
#> [1] "349.1 Kb"
```

Success!
