```{r, setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  class.output  = "bg-success",
  class.message = "bg-info text-info",
  class.warning = "bg-warning text-warning",
  class.error   = "bg-danger text-danger"

It didn't take long, actually. Despite my searches while trying to get [images into x-axis labels](https://jcarroll.com.au/2016/06/02/images-as-x-axis-labels/) it seems I overlooked a working, [significantly less hacky implementation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14070953/photo-alignment-with-graph-in-r/14078391). My Google-fu had in fact let me down.

Baptiste Augui√© ([@tpab](https://twitter.com/tpab) / [@baptiste](https://github.com/baptiste)) had this working a while ago (seemingly before the `ggplot2` update that broke other methods), and in a definitively less hacky way. I've added a [new gist](https://gist.github.com/jonocarroll/2f9490f1f5e7c82ef8b791a4b91fc9ca) (if you're reading this on R-bloggers, the gist isn't embedded, so either follow the link or view on my site) which implements it on the same graph as earlier, and I like this significantly more.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
cat("{{% gist jonocarroll 2f9490f1f5e7c82ef8b791a4b91fc9ca %}}")
```

This method gets around the `element_text()` validation and updates the grobs in a way that's above my pay grade/understanding of `ggplot2` internals, and is a much more consistent way to go about it. This also:
<ul>
	<li> places the factor labels on the graph along with the picture, covering some concerns about people not knowing which maps are for which country,</li>
	<li> leaves room for the `caption` to go back in, which I wanted,</li>
	<li> automatically scales the grob better,</li>
	<li> doesn't involve creating an external `grob` and thus turning off clipping; using `axis.text.x` is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
</ul>

![Updated version using @baptiste's method; much better.](/post/2016-06-03-images-as-x-axis-labels-updated_files/GDP_updated.png)

My version worked (sort of) but only because it used options that were bad practice (not doubting that for a moment). I'd like to see this method make it into `ggplot2` properly; Baptiste had an [open GitHub issue](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/issues/1240) involving it a while ago but it has since been closed, presumably without the feature being incorporated.

I started the previous post by saying how awesome open-source software is (e.g. `R`). You know what else is awesome? The #rstats community. Thank you to every one of you.
