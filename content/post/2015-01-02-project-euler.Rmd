As a means of honing my [R](http://www.r-project.org/) programming skills, I've decided to tackle the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) questions exclusively using my new favourite programming language. Besides, it seems that R can do just about everything; surely it can handle some programming games. If I get the time, I'll add updates in other languages as I build my knowledge of them.

R is not going to be the best language for some of the questions (I see some very Python-suitable questions) but they should all be do-able in R, and I'd bet R beats some of the others in at least a few questions.

I'll try to post a solution or two a week at least, along side my other projects. There's about 500 questions available, presumably increasing in difficulty, so that's quite a depth of material to cover.

If you know of a good improvement that can be made, by all means drop a line in the comments.

It should be noted however, as per the Project Euler site;

<blockquote>
<h3>I learned so much solving problem XXX so is it okay to publish my solution elsewhere?</h3>
It appears that you have answered your own question. There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, however, that will not be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself.
</blockquote>

so if you're planning on tackling these yourself, you're better off steering clear of these posts for now and comparing solutions later. That's what I'm doing at least.
