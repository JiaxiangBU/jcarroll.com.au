```{r, setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
class.output= "bg-success",
class.message = "bg-info text-info",
class.warning = "bg-warning text-warning",
class.error= "bg-danger text-danger"
)
```

I owe a lot to Jeff Leek and Roger Peng for their great Coursera courses, in which I learned to program in R.

They (along with Rafa Irizarry) run the [Simply Statistics](http://simplystatistics.org/) blog, which I highly reccomend. They posted a Thanksgiving puzzle in which a data.frame needs to be converted from one form to another, spelling out 'thanksgiving'.

Suggestions on how I could have done this differently (or automated solutions) most welcome!
