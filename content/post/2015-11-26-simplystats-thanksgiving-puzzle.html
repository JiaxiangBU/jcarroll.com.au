<p>They (along with Rafa Irizarry) run the <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/">Simply Statistics</a> blog, which I highly reccomend. They posted a Thanksgiving puzzle in which a data.frame needs to be converted from one form to another, spelling out ‘thanksgiving’.</p>

<p>Suggestions on how I could have done this differently (or automated solutions) most welcome!</p>
