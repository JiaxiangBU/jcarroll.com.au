<p><a href="https://xianblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/21/an-integer-programming-riddle/">This neat approach</a> showed up recently as an answer to a <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-have-1-billion-to-win-a-space-race-go/">FiveThirtyEight puzzle</a> and of course I couldn’t help but throw it at <code>dplyr</code> as soon as I could. Turns out that’s not a terrible idea. The question posed is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>optimise</p>
<p>200a + 100b + 50c + 25d</p>
<p>under the constraints</p>
<p>400a + 400b + 150c + 50d ≤ 1000,
b ≤ a,
a ≤ 1,
c ≤ 8,
d ≤ 4,</p>
and (a,b,c,d) all non-negative integers.
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving aside any interpretations of wording of the original question (let’s just start with trying to solve <em>this</em> system of inequalities) <a href="https://xianblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/21/an-integer-programming-riddle/">the solution provided used 4 nested loops</a>, which can definitely be avoided.</p>
<p>My approach was to create all possible combinations of the 4 variables (within the given constraints), filter out the ones that don’t meet the constraint criteria, then sort by the evaluating expression to find which one does best.</p>

<p>I’m not suggesting that this is by any means always the best approach, but when the phase-space of possible solutions is so low (especially combinations of small integers) then this is pretty tidy (technically a single <code>dplyr</code> chain).</p>
<p>Alternatively, one could set this up as an equation and use a linear solver. In that case, we want to optimise <span class="math inline">\(\max(\|A x\|)\)</span> subject to the constraints <span class="math inline">\(G x \ge h\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> represent the coefficients and variables to be optimised, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> the constraint vector, and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> a matrix of coefficients for the constraints. For the system we’re looking at, that matrix inequality looks like this</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \left[\begin{array}{cccc}400 &amp; 400 &amp; 150 &amp; 50 \\1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right] \left[\begin{array}{c}a \\ b \\ c \\ d\end{array}\right] \le \left[\begin{array}{c}1000 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 8 \\ 4\end{array}\right]\ . \]</span></p>
<p>Of course, the constraint that <span class="math inline">\(b \le a\)</span> needs to be checked after the fact.</p>
<p>Programming this is fairly straightforward, even with the constraint that these are integer solutions. <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/limSolve/docs/linp"><code>limSolve::linp</code></a> is made for exactly these types of problems.</p>

<p>which results in the same answer as our manual brute-force search.</p>
<p>One last thing to try is to plot the solution space and see how it looks. Sounds like a good opportunity to try out <a href="https://plot.ly/">plotly</a>.</p>
<p>Since this is technically a 5D plot (4 variables and a value) it’s a little difficult to visualise. I’ve reduced the dimensionality by treating each unique combination of <span class="math inline">\(a \le 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b \le a\)</span> (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(00,~01,~10,~11\)</span>) as a group and using colour to distinguish those. The plot below should show up as a 3D object, so click, drag, and scroll it to have a closer look. Clicking on a group will remove/add it so you can get a clearer view, and hovering over a point should bring up the values of the axes and evaluation.</p>

<p>Going back to the expression that’s being optimised it’s pretty clear why it’s broken down into 4 planes when grouped this way (substitute different values of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> to see).</p>
<p>Do you have another way to solve this? Drop a line or a link in the comments.</p>
