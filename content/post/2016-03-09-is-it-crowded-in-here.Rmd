```{r, setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
class.output= "bg-success",
class.message = "bg-info text-info",
class.warning = "bg-warning text-warning",
class.error= "bg-danger text-danger"
)
```

[This was a neat graphic that someone made](http://i.imgur.com/5sYruU9.jpg). It shows the population at a given latitude or longitude as a bar chart, overlayed on a map of the world itself. It shows where people live; the bigger the bar, the more people living at that latitude/longitude.

I love that such a small amount of code can produce something so interesting. Click the images below to view them in all their full-size glory.

How is this useful? Well... okay, it's not. It's pretty. That's what it is. An a neat exercise in data manipulation and plotting.

UPDATE: As per a comment on my reddit thread, I've updated this to include a logarithmic colour-scale for population. The populations follow a nice logit curve if you arrange them in order:
